live-demo-macs
==============

This repository houses widgets, operators and mashups created specifically for the FIWARE live demo. Being it a live you should expect that the code evolves in each release cycle. Each version will be released in a different folder. In this repository you can find the folders for the two releases made available at the moment.

Live demo also uses other generic widgets from the Wireloud catalogue that can be found in the following repositories:

* Map Viewer: https://github.com/Wirecloud/map-viewer-widget
* Photo Viewer: https://github.com/Wirecloud/photo-viewer-widget
* Chat: https://github.com/Wirecloud/chat-widget
* Time Slider: https://github.com/Wirecloud/time-slider-widget
* Send SMS: https://github.com/Wirecloud/send-sms

See the main [FIWARE Live Demo repo](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-livedemoapp) for general information about this demo.
